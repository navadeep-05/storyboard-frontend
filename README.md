# Storyboard Frontend

This is a React + Vite + Tailwind app that connects to the Hugging Face backend [`Sample_storyboard`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/navadeep-j/Sample_storyboard) to generate AI images from prompts.

## Run Locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build for Netlify
```bash
npm run build
```
Output will be in `/dist`. Deploy it on Netlify with build command `npm run build` and publish directory `dist`.
```
